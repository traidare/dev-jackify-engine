# Jackify-Engine Changelog

Jackify-Engine is a Linux-native fork of Wabbajack CLI that provides full modlist installation capability on Linux systems using Proton for texture processing.

## Version 0.5.0 - TBD
### Bug Fixes
* **Exception classifier**: Added `StructuredError.Classify(Exception)` — a single shared method that maps exception types to structured error types and messages (`disk_error`, `disk_full`, `permission_denied`, `network_error`, `auth_failed`, `engine_error`). All catch sites in `Install.Run`, `DownloadMachineUrl`, and `UnhandledException` now use the classifier instead of duplicated inline logic or hardcoded `engine_error` fallbacks. Adds new `disk_error` type (exit 4) for OS-level I/O read failures distinct from `disk_full`.
* **`installer.Begin()` exceptions unhandled**: Any exception thrown during installation (I/O errors, permission denied, network failures, etc.) previously escaped to the `UnhandledException` fallback and was always reported as `engine_error` exit 6. Now caught at the call site with proper classification.
* **`PathTooLongException` misclassified**: Previously fell through to the `IOException` → `disk_error` branch in `Classify()`, producing a misleading "failing storage device" message. Now classified as `validation_failed` (exit 5) with a message explaining the filesystem filename length limit and suggesting a non-encrypted install location.
* **Pre-flight validation**: Three checks now run after the modlist loads but before archive downloads begin, preventing failures mid-install or post-download:
  - **Game installed**: `IsInstalled()` checked upfront — previously `GameLocation()` threw outside the try/catch and escaped as a raw stack trace + exit 1.
  - **Filesystem NAME_MAX**: `pathconf()` probed on the install path to detect filesystems with reduced filename length limits (e.g. eCryptFS/fscrypt encrypted home directories). Scans all modlist directive paths and fails immediately with the offending names if any exceed the limit.
  - **Disk space**: Free space on the install drive checked against the sum of directive sizes before downloading begins.

### New Features
* **Manual download protocol**: Engine now communicates with Jackify GUI via a structured JSON stdin/stdout protocol for non-premium users and explicitly-manual archives.
  - Emits `manual_download_required` JSON events to stdout (one per missing file) with `file_name`, `nexus_url`, `expected_hash`, `expected_size`, `mod_name`, `mod_id`, `file_id`, `index`, `total`
  - Emits `manual_download_list_complete` and blocks on stdin waiting for `{"command":"continue"}`
  - On receipt of continue: rescans downloads directory, re-emits any still-missing files (incrementing `loop_iteration`), repeats until all found
  - Emits `manual_download_phase_complete` and continues installation normally once all files are present
  - Replaces the old unstructured log output and install-halting behavior for manual downloads
* **Non-premium Nexus hang fixed**: `NexusDownloader.DownloadManually()` previously blocked forever awaiting a browser download task that CLI mode never resolved. It now throws `ManualDownloadRequiredException` immediately, routing through the protocol instead.
* **Cleaner premium warnings**: Removed the ASCII-art box warnings for non-premium Nexus (Jackify GUI now handles UX for this case).
* **Nexus ToS compliance**: Non-premium accounts now have ALL Nexus archives routed to the manual download protocol upfront, before any download attempt. Premium status is checked once via `NexusApi.IsPremium()` at the start of the download phase; if non-premium, no Nexus CDN URL API call is ever made. The `nexus_url` in `manual_download_required` events now includes `file_id` (e.g. `?tab=files&file_id=462377`) so Jackify can open the browser directly to the correct file's download page.

## Version 0.4.8 - 2026-02-17
### Improvements
* **Remaining download size**: "Downloading Mod Archives" progress line now shows remaining GB (e.g. `(12/87) - 4.2MB/s - 23.1GB remaining`); counter decrements continuously as in-progress bytes are received, not only when an archive finishes
* **Stdout output quality**: Removed spurious blank lines after every section header and progress update; removed `[HH:MM:SS]` elapsed-time prefix from all stdout lines (Jackify adds its own wall-clock timestamp, making the engine prefix produce double-timestamp noise in logs); `[FILE_PROGRESS]` lines written to stdout with newline so Jackify's line-by-line capture sees each line; install-phase heartbeat moved to stderr to avoid duplicating the stdout progress line
* **Progress polling**: Display loops poll every 250ms (was 1000ms) for smoother progress updates
* **GE-Proton / ProtonFixes**: When initializing Proton, the engine now ensures `~/.config/protonfixes` exists.
* **Structured error output**: Engine now emits JSON error lines to stderr on failure, tagged with `"je":"1"` for consumption by the Jackify Python frontend. Each line includes `level`, `type`, `message`, and optional `context` fields. Covers all classified failure paths: `auth_failed`, `premium_required`, `network_error`, `disk_full`, `permission_denied`, `archive_corrupt`, `file_not_found`, `validation_failed`, `engine_error`.
* **Meaningful exit codes**: Exit codes 2–6 now map to specific failure categories (2=auth, 3=network, 4=disk/IO, 5=validation, 6=engine). Exit code 1 retained as fallback for unknown/cancelled paths. Fully backward-compatible — old Jackify versions ignore stderr entirely.
* **Crash handler**: `AppDomain.UnhandledException` handler registered in `Program.Main` ensures a structured `engine_error` line is emitted even for exceptions that escape the CLI pipeline (e.g. DI host construction failures), with exit code 6.

### Bug Fixes
* **Download speed always 0.0MB/s**: `TransferMetrics` rewritten to read NIC byte counters from `/proc/net/dev` on a 500ms timer; default interface detected via `/proc/net/route` (unambiguous default-route lookup). Replaces the previous ring-buffer approach and the earlier `BandwidthMonitor` class that picked the wrong interface on multi-NIC systems.
* **ZIP extraction with Cyrillic filenames**: Added Cyrillic to `ProblematicChars` so archives with Cyrillic filenames (e.g. Soule-like Music, BottleRim) are routed to Proton 7z.exe instead of Linux 7zz, fixing "N results, expected M" sanity check failures
* **Stale OAuth token blocks fresh session**: When an encrypted OAuth token file fails to refresh (e.g. token revoked after re-auth in Jackify GUI), the stale file is now deleted and the engine falls through to the `NEXUS_OAUTH_INFO` env var containing the fresh token. Previously a stale file permanently blocked a freshly-authenticated session.

## Version 0.4.7 - 2026-01-28
### Critical Bug Fixes
* **ModOrganizer.ini Path Quoting**: Fixed incorrect quoting/escaping of MO2 `customExecutables` by writing clean, unquoted Proton `Z:\...` paths in `ModOrganizer.ini`

## Version 0.4.6 - 2026-01-12
### Critical Bug Fixes
* **.wabbajack Download Source Array Bounds**: Fixed "Source array was not long enough" exception during .wabbajack file downloads
  - Added source array bounds checking in `AChunkedBufferingStream.ReadAsync` to prevent underflow when `chunkOffset >= chunkData.Length`
  - Completes the incomplete fix from v0.4.1 which only addressed destination buffer bounds
* **Foreign Character Detection False Positives**: Fixed false positive foreign character detection causing 7z and RAR archives to incorrectly route to Proton 7z.exe extraction
  - Restricted proactive foreign character detection to skip 7z archives (UTF-8 native, safe with Linux 7zz)
  - ZIP and RAR archives still checked proactively for encoding issues
  - Added diagnostic logging to show which files and characters trigger detection
  - Exit code 2 and sanity check fallbacks still work for all archive types (reparse points, symlinks, missed encoding issues)
  - Fixes installation failures where 7z archives that extract fine with Linux 7zz were incorrectly routed to Proton and failed
* **Nexus OAuth Token Refresh**: Rectified incorrect Nexus Client ID references
* **DirectoryNotFoundException for meta.ini Files**: Fixed installation failures during "Installing Included Files" phase when writing meta.ini files to directories with case-sensitive name mismatches
  - Regression in `CreateDirectory()` was returning early when a case-insensitive directory match was found, preventing creation of the exact-case directory needed on Linux
  - Removed early return in `AbsolutePathExtensions.CreateDirectory()` to ensure exact-case directories are created even when case-insensitive matches exist
  - Added explicit parent directory creation and verification in `StandardInstaller.InstallIncludedFiles()` before writing inline files
  - Fixes failures like "Could not find a part of the path '/path/to/Additional Dremora Faces/meta.ini'" when directory exists with different case (e.g., "Additional Dremora faces")

## Version 0.4.5 - 2025-01-02
### Critical Bug Fixes
* **Archive Extraction with Backslashes**: Fixed regression where files with backslashes in filenames weren't being converted to directory structure when extracted via Proton 7z.exe
  - Added post-processing call to `GatheringExtractWithProton7Zip` to fix backslashes (Linux 7zz path already had this)
* **Data Directory Path**: Fixed `TemporaryFileManager` using hardcoded lowercase `~/jackify` instead of honoring user-configured data directory
  - Now reads `jackify_data_dir` from `~/.config/jackify/config.json` (inlined to avoid circular dependency)
  - Falls back to `~/Jackify` (capitalized) if config read fails, instead of creating `~/jackify` (lowercase)
* **.wabbajack File Hash Validation**: Removed post-download hash validation to match upstream Wabbajack behavior
  - Upstream Wabbajack only validates hash before download (to check if file exists), not after download
  - File integrity is still checked when loading the modlist (will fail if corrupted)
  - Fixes installation failures when metadata hash doesn't match actual file hash (rare edge case)
* **Pattern Matching for Archives with Backslashes**: Fixed extraction failures for archives containing files with backslash path separators
  - Updated `GetPatterns` to include both backslash and forward-slash variants (matches upstream Wabbajack's `AllVariants`)
  - 7zip pattern matching is literal and requires exact separator matches
  - Fixes cases where Linux 7zz extracted 0 files because forward-slash patterns didn't match backslash paths in archive
  - Negligible performance impact (<0.1s overhead for 40-minute installation)
* **.wabbajack Download Progress Tracking**: Fixed `System.ArgumentException: Destination array was not long enough` error during .wabbajack file downloads
  - Replaced `ConcurrentQueue<T>` with `Queue<T>` and added proper locking for thread-safe access
  - Prevents race condition when `ToArray()` is called while queue is being modified concurrently
  - Matches the working pattern used in `DownloadModlist.cs`

## Version 0.4.4 - 2025-01-XX

### Improvements
* **Proton Detection**: Now parses `libraryfolders.vdf` to find Proton in additional Steam library folders
* **Nexus OAuth Logging**: Enhanced validation logging (actual bug fixed in Jackify v0.2.0.5)

## Version 0.4.3 - 2025-12-21
### Improvements
* **Improved Error Logging**: Exception messages now display user-friendly error descriptions instead of technical stack traces
  - User-friendly error messages are always shown (no `--debug` flag required)
  - Technical messages like "Sequence contains no matching element" are translated to clear explanations
  - File paths, hashes, and context are extracted and displayed prominently
  - Stack traces and technical details (exception type, original message) are hidden by default, shown only with `--debug` flag
  - Makes errors much more understandable for non-technical users
* **Destination Case-Sensitivity Hotfix**: Prevent installation failures when `mods/` subdirectories differ only by case
  - When installing files from archives, `AInstaller` now reuses an existing directory whose name matches case-insensitively (e.g. `translations/` vs `Translations/`, `Scripts/` vs `scripts/`)
  - Only applies when the original destination parent directory does not exist; successful installs are unchanged
  - Fixes update failures for large lists like Lorerim without requiring a full reinstall or re-download

### Critical Bug Fixes
* **Game File Download Case Sensitivity**: Fixed "Unable to download" errors for game files (Fallout4.exe, Data files, etc.) when modlist uses different casing than actual files
  - Added case-insensitive file lookup in `GameFileDownloader` using existing `FindCaseInsensitive()` method
  - Fixes: Modlist has `fallout4.exe` but actual file is `Fallout4.exe` on Linux filesystem
  - Affects: FO4 modlists like Anomaly that require game file downloads
  - Root cause: Linux filesystems are case-sensitive, modlists compiled on Windows use lowercase paths
* **Archive Extraction Pattern File Explosion**: Eliminated exponential case variant generation causing multi-GB pattern files and installation failures
  - OLD: AllVariants() generated 3^N case combinations per path (N = directory depth), creating up to 531,441 pattern lines per deeply nested file
  - User-reported symptom: 3.5GB pattern file found in temp directory, matching calculated 4.5GB for 4,808 files
  - NEW: Simple path separator variants (3 lines per file) + 7zip `-ssc-` flag for case-insensitive matching
  - Reduction: 2.5 billion pattern lines → 14,424 lines (173,000x smaller), 4.5GB → 2MB pattern file
  - Fixes: Installation crashes, out-of-memory exceptions, and "exit code 7" errors during archive extraction
  - Regression introduced in v0.4.1 when AllVariants() recursive case generation was added
* **File Installation Case Sensitivity**: Fixed DirectoryNotFoundException during file installation when directory case mismatches
  - Path normalization now happens BEFORE CreateDirectory() instead of catching exception after
  - Fixes: modlist directive says `scripts/` but `Scripts/` exists on disk → use existing `Scripts/` directory
  - Prevents creation of duplicate directories with different cases
  - Applies to both ExtractedNativeFile and ExtractedMemoryFile code paths

## Version 0.4.1 - 2025-12-19
### Critical Bug Fixes
* **Archive Extraction Case Sensitivity**: Fixed extraction failures when 7zip normalizes mixed-case archive paths (e.g., `Fairy/` → `fairy/`)
  - Added 7zip `-ssc-` flag and recursive path variant generation for case-insensitive matching
  - Fixes "Sanity check error extracting...0 results, expected N" failures
* **Download Reliability**: Fixed "Source array was not long enough" exception in chunked download buffering causing random download failures
  - Fixed incorrect bitwise XOR operator (should be bitwise AND with inverted mask) in chunk offset calculation
  - Added missing Position increment after array copy
  - Added destination buffer bounds checking to prevent "Destination array was not long enough" errors
* **BSA Case Sensitivity**: Added case-insensitive path matching for BSA building on Linux (handles "scripts/hardcore" vs "scripts/Hardcore" mismatches)
* **Meta File Write Failures**: Meta file creation failures no longer abort completed installations (meta files are non-critical post-install metadata)

### Performance Improvements
* **Meta File Optimization**: Skip writing .meta files that already exist, avoiding redundant hash operations
* **Progress Tracking**: Thread-safe progress reporting with ConcurrentQueue for .wabbajack downloads

### Upstream Updates
* **Google Drive Downloads**: Fixed handling of direct download links (application/octet-stream content type) from Google Drive
* **Multi-Game File Sourcing**: Added support for sourcing game files from multiple game folders (e.g., Fallout: New Vegas can source files from Fallout 3)

## Version 0.4.0 - 2025-12-06
### GUI Integration
* Added `--json` flag to `list-modlists` command for structured metadata output
* New `download-modlist-images` command for batch image download
* Added `--show-file-progress` flag for detailed progress tracking

* GPU-accelerated texture conversion via Proton/DXVK
* Automatic NVIDIA and AMD dGPU detection and configuration

## Version 0.3.19 - 2025-11-13
### Download Reliability Improvements
* **Resume Support**: Fixed download restart issue - partial files are now preserved on timeout, allowing resume instead of restart
* **Exception Handling**: Matched upstream Wabbajack behavior - TaskCanceledException (timeouts) now properly handled to allow silent resume
* **Hash Mismatch Logic**: Empty hash (incomplete downloads) no longer triggers file deletion - only actual hash mismatches delete files
* **Partial File Exclusion**: Partial downloads are excluded from hash checking (only exact size matches are hashed) to prevent false hash mismatches

### User Experience Improvements
* **BSA Progress Messages**: Building/Writing/Verifying BSA messages now overwrite the same line instead of creating new lines for cleaner output
* **Progress Line Clearing**: Progress line is properly cleared after BSA building completes

### Archive Extraction Error Messages
* **Improved Error Reporting**: Better error messages when both Linux 7zz and Proton 7z.exe fail to extract archives
* **User Guidance**: Clear instructions to manually delete corrupted archives and re-run installation
* **Synthesis.zip Note**: Specific guidance for archives like Synthesis.zip that use the same filename across versions

## Version 0.3.18 - 2025-11-05
### Archive Extraction Fix
* **Proton Fallback**: Exit code 2 (fatal errors) now automatically retries with Proton 7z.exe for ZIP/7Z/RAR archives
* **Reparse Point Support**: Fixes archives containing Windows symlinks/reparse points that Linux 7zz cannot handle
* **Error Reporting**: Fixed 7zip stderr capture showing type names instead of actual error messages

### Bandwidth Limiting (Throughput) Fix
* **Effective Throttling**: Fixed download pipeline not honoring `MaxThroughput` from `resource_settings.json`
* **Root Cause**: Downloader reported progress with `ReportNoWait`, bypassing the limiter
* **Implementation**: Now reports byte deltas via throttling-aware `Report(...)` and flushes remaining bytes at completion
* **Scope**: Applies to all HTTP downloads using the resumable downloader

### Nexus Premium Error Messages
* **Clear Non-Premium Detection**: Added prominent console error message when Nexus Premium is not detected (before downloads start)
* **User Guidance**: Explains why downloads appear stuck at 0MB/s and provides options (purchase Premium or continue with manual downloads)
* **403 Forbidden Handling**: Improved error message for 403 responses (edge case: Premium status changed or API rejection) to clearly indicate Premium requirement
* **Single Warning**: Shows the Premium warning only once per session to avoid console spam

### Download Failure Messaging
* **Concise Errors**: Per-file failures now show archive name, source, and a usable URL without dumping stack traces
* **Debug Detail**: Full exception details moved to debug logs for troubleshooting
* **Non-Blocking**: Installer continues remaining downloads; failures are summarized at the end

## Version 0.3.17 - 2025-10-09
### Google Drive Downloads
* **Request URI Fix**: Fixed "Request URI is null" error in Google Drive downloader when form parsing fails or response isn't HTML
* **Fallback Logic**: Added proper fallback to direct download URL when Google Drive form detection fails

### .wabbajack File Hash Verification Fix
* **Hash Cache Issue**: Fixed corrupted .wabbajack files being used due to stale hash cache entries
* **Fresh Hash Verification**: .wabbajack files now always verify actual file hash instead of using cached values

### ModOrganizer.ini Path Handling Fix
* **Spaces in Directory Names**: Fixed Wine path conversion to properly quote paths containing spaces

### Proton Selection and Window Suppression (Linux)
* **Config-Aware Proton**: Reads `proton_path` from `~/.config/jackify/config.json` and uses `${proton_path}/proton`
* **Detection Order**: GE-Proton10-* (compatibilitytools.d) → Proton - Experimental → Proton 10.0 → Proton 9.0
* **No Wine Fallback**: Proton is now required; if not found, a clear error is logged
* **Window Suppression**: Suppresses Proton console windows via `DISPLAY=""`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY=""`, and `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="msdia80.dll=n;conhost.exe=d;cmd.exe=d` for texconv/texdiag/7z and prefix init
* **Debug Trace**: With `--debug`, logs a single line indicating Proton source (config/GE/Valve version)

### Archive Extraction Encoding Fix
* **Foreign Character Coverage**: Added degree symbol `°` to the special character list used to trigger the Proton 7z.exe fallback
* **User Report**: Handles files like `Mirror°.nif` correctly by routing extraction through Proton 7z.exe when needed

## Version 0.3.14 - 2025-09-15
### Nexus API Error Handling Improvements
* **404 Not Found Handling**: Added specific error messages for missing/removed Nexus mods with actionable user guidance
* **Enhanced Error Logging**: Improved error reporting with ArchiveName, Game, ModID, and FileID context for better troubleshooting
* **Manual Download Logic**: Removed inappropriate 404 fallback to manual downloads (file doesn't exist) while preserving 403 Forbidden fallback for auth issues

### Configurable Data Directory
* **Shared Config Integration**: jackify-engine now reads `jackify_data_dir` from `~/.config/jackify/config.json`
* **Replaced Hardcoded Paths**: All `~/Jackify/*` usages now use the configured data directory (prefixes, logs, temp, `.engine`, `downloaded_mod_lists`)
* **Complete Path Migration**: All application data now uses the configurable directory including caches (`GlobalHashCache2.sqlite`, `GlobalVFSCache5.sqlite`, `VerificationCacheV3.sqlite`, `PatchCache/`), encrypted data, image cache, and token storage.
* **Safe Fallback**: If config read fails, defaults to `~/Jackify`

## Version 0.3.13 - 2025-09-13 (STABLE)
### Wine Prefix Cleanup & Download System Fixes
* **Wine Prefix Cleanup**: Implemented automatic cleanup of ~281MB Wine prefix directories after each modlist installation
* **Manual Download Handling**: Fixed installation crashes when manual downloads are required - now stops cleanly instead of continuing with KeyNotFoundException
* **Download Error Messaging**: Enhanced error reporting with detailed mod information (Nexus Game/ModID/FileID, Google Drive, HTTP sources) for better troubleshooting
* **GoogleDrive & MEGA Integration**: Fixed download regressions and integrated with Jackify's configuration system
* **Creation Club File Handling**: Fixed incorrect re-download attempts for Creation Club files with hash mismatches (e.g., Curios case sensitivity issues)

* **MEGA Token Provider**: Modified to use Jackify config directory (~/.config/jackify/encrypted/) while maintaining upstream security
* **EncryptedJsonTokenProvider**: Made KeyPath virtual to allow path override for Jackify integration
* **GameFileSource Filter**: Excluded GameFileSource files from re-download logic to prevent incorrect re-download attempts for locally sourced files
* **ExtractedMemoryFile**: Added parent directory creation in Move method to prevent DirectoryNotFoundException during BSA extraction
* **VFS Context**: Added missing Limiter parameter to PDoAll calls to respect VFS MaxTasks setting from resource_settings.json, and defensive error handling in BackfillMissing for missing archives
* **StandardInstaller**: Added missing Limiter parameter to InlineFile processing to respect Installer MaxTasks setting, and moved missing archive detection earlier to prevent VFS crashes

### Bug Fixes
* **GoogleDrive Downloads**: Fixed 'Request URI is null' error and added handling for application/octet-stream content type responses
* **Manual Download Flow**: Installation now returns InstallResult.DownloadFailed when manual downloads are required instead of crashing
* **Error Context**: Generic 'Http Error NotFound' messages now include specific file name, source, and original error details
* **MEGA Compatibility**: Restored upstream MEGA behavior while integrating with Jackify's configuration system
* **Creation Club File Re-download**: Fixed incorrect re-download attempts for Creation Club files with hash mismatches - now properly handled as locally sourced files
* **BSA Building DirectoryNotFoundException**: Fixed crashes during BSA building when parent directories don't exist - now creates directories automatically
* **Resource Settings Ignored**: Fixed VFS and Installer operations ignoring configured MaxTasks settings - now properly respects resource_settings.json limits
* **VFS Priming KeyNotFoundException**: Fixed KeyNotFoundException crashes with missing archive hashes (e.g., 'MXmKeWd+KkI=') during VFS priming - now detects missing archives early with clear error messages

### User Experience
* **Disk Space Management**: No more accumulation of Wine prefix directories consuming hundreds of MB per installation
* **Clean Error Handling**: Manual download requirements now show clear summary instead of stack traces
* **Better Troubleshooting**: Download failures now show exactly which mod/file failed and where it came from
* **Configuration Integration**: MEGA tokens properly stored in Jackify's config directory structure
* **Resource Control**: Users can now properly control CPU usage during installation by modifying resource_settings.json (VFS, Installer, File Extractor MaxTasks)

## Version 0.3.11 - 2025-09-07 (STABLE)
### Proton Path Detection Fix - Dynamic System Compatibility
* **Fixed Hardcoded Paths**: Replaced hardcoded `/home/deck` Proton paths in 7z.exe fallback with dynamic detection

* **Foreign Character Support**: Maintains 7z.exe fallback functionality for archives with Nordic, Romance, and Slavic characters

## Version 0.3.10 - 2025-09-01 (STABLE)
### HTTP Rate Limiting Fix - Download Stall Resolution
* **Configurable Resource Settings**: Fixed hardcoded 4 concurrent HTTP requests causing 20-30s download stalls
* **Upstream Compatibility**: Now uses `GetResourceSettings("Web Requests")` matching upstream Wabbajack behavior
* **Dynamic Concurrency**: Automatically scales to `Environment.ProcessorCount` (typically 8-16) concurrent requests
* **Download Performance**: Eliminates .wabbajack file download stalls and improves overall download reliability
* **Resource Management**: Both HTTP client and Wabbajack client now use configurable settings instead of hardcoded limits

### Critical Disk Space Fix - Temporary File Cleanup
* **__temp__ Directory Cleanup**: Fixed critical bug where 17GB+ temporary files were left behind after installation
* **Automatic Cleanup**: Added proper cleanup of `__temp__` directory containing extracted modlist files and processing artifacts
* **Professional Progress Display**: Added "=== Removing Temporary Files ===" section with progress indicators
* **Disk Space Recovery**: Eliminates accumulation of temporary files that could consume hundreds of GB over multiple installations
* **Upstream Compatibility**: Matches upstream Wabbajack's approach to temporary file management

### Foreign Character Archive Extraction Fix
* **ZIP Encoding Detection**: Added comprehensive foreign character detection for ZIP archives (Nordic: ö,ä,ü; Romance: á,é,í; Slavic: ć,č,đ; Other: ß,þ,ð)
* **Proton 7z.exe Fallback**: Automatic fallback to Windows 7z.exe via Proton for archives with problematic character encodings
* **Zero Overhead Design**: Normal archives (99.99%) continue using fast Linux 7zz extraction
* **Path Resolution Fix**: Fixed KnownFolders.EntryPoint path construction causing double "publish" directory issue
* **Archive Format Intelligence**: 7Z archives work perfectly (UTF-8 native), ZIP archives with encoding issues automatically use Proton

## Project History

Jackify-Engine represents the **10th attempt** at creating a Linux-native Wabbajack fork. Previous attempts were destroyed by AI agents making unnecessary modifications to core systems that worked perfectly in upstream Wabbajack.

### Key Principles
* **Minimal Changes**: Only essential Linux compatibility modifications
* **Upstream Compatibility**: 1:1 identical output hashes to upstream Wabbajack
* **Performance Parity**: Target ≤39 minutes installation time (matching upstream via Wine)
* **Self-Contained**: No external dependencies required for published binary

### Critical Systems (Never Modified)
* Archive extraction logic (Wabbajack.FileExtractor)
* Resume functionality and temp directory handling
* VFS (Virtual File System) operations
* Core installation flow (StandardInstaller.Begin)
* 7zip integration and error handling

### Linux-Specific Features
* **Proton Integration**: Uses Steam Proton for texconv.exe execution
* **Linux Steam Detection**: Automatic detection of Linux Steam installations
* **Path Handling**: Linux-specific path conversion and case sensitivity handling
* **Build System**: Linux-optimized build script and distribution packaging
