# Jackify-Engine Changelog

Jackify-Engine is a Linux-native fork of Wabbajack CLI that provides full modlist installation capability on Linux systems using Proton for texture processing.

## Version 0.3.19 - 2025-11-13
### Download Reliability Improvements
* **Resume Support**: Fixed download restart issue - partial files are now preserved on timeout, allowing resume instead of restart
* **Exception Handling**: Matched upstream Wabbajack behavior - TaskCanceledException (timeouts) now properly handled to allow silent resume
* **Hash Mismatch Logic**: Empty hash (incomplete downloads) no longer triggers file deletion - only actual hash mismatches delete files
* **Partial File Exclusion**: Partial downloads are excluded from hash checking (only exact size matches are hashed) to prevent false hash mismatches

### User Experience Improvements
* **BSA Progress Messages**: Building/Writing/Verifying BSA messages now overwrite the same line instead of creating new lines for cleaner output
* **Progress Line Clearing**: Progress line is properly cleared after BSA building completes

### Archive Extraction Error Messages
* **Improved Error Reporting**: Better error messages when both Linux 7zz and Proton 7z.exe fail to extract archives
* **User Guidance**: Clear instructions to manually delete corrupted archives and re-run installation
* **Synthesis.zip Note**: Specific guidance for archives like Synthesis.zip that use the same filename across versions

## Version 0.3.18 - 2025-11-05
### Archive Extraction Fix
* **Proton Fallback**: Exit code 2 (fatal errors) now automatically retries with Proton 7z.exe for ZIP/7Z/RAR archives
* **Reparse Point Support**: Fixes archives containing Windows symlinks/reparse points that Linux 7zz cannot handle
* **Error Reporting**: Fixed 7zip stderr capture showing type names instead of actual error messages

### Bandwidth Limiting (Throughput) Fix
* **Effective Throttling**: Fixed download pipeline not honoring `MaxThroughput` from `resource_settings.json`
* **Root Cause**: Downloader reported progress with `ReportNoWait`, bypassing the limiter
* **Implementation**: Now reports byte deltas via throttling-aware `Report(...)` and flushes remaining bytes at completion
* **Scope**: Applies to all HTTP downloads using the resumable downloader

### Nexus Premium Error Messages
* **Clear Non-Premium Detection**: Added prominent console error message when Nexus Premium is not detected (before downloads start)
* **User Guidance**: Explains why downloads appear stuck at 0MB/s and provides options (purchase Premium or continue with manual downloads)
* **403 Forbidden Handling**: Improved error message for 403 responses (edge case: Premium status changed or API rejection) to clearly indicate Premium requirement
* **Single Warning**: Shows the Premium warning only once per session to avoid console spam

### Download Failure Messaging
* **Concise Errors**: Per-file failures now show archive name, source, and a usable URL without dumping stack traces
* **Debug Detail**: Full exception details moved to debug logs for troubleshooting
* **Non-Blocking**: Installer continues remaining downloads; failures are summarized at the end

## Version 0.3.17 - 2025-10-09
### Google Drive Downloads
* **Request URI Fix**: Fixed "Request URI is null" error in Google Drive downloader when form parsing fails or response isn't HTML
* **Fallback Logic**: Added proper fallback to direct download URL when Google Drive form detection fails

### User Experience
* **Progress Indication**: Added progress indicators to "Hashing downloads" and "Looking for unmodified files" phases that previously showed no progress during large operations

## Version 0.3.16 - 2025-09-30
### Archive Extraction
* **Sanity Check Fallback**: Added Proton 7z.exe fallback for case sensitivity extraction failures

### Download Command
* **download-wabbajack-file**: Added CLI command to download .wabbajack files by machineURL

### Texture Processing
* **Enhanced Error Messages**: Improved texconv/texdiag error messages to include original texture file names and conversion parameters

### Logging
* **Noise Reduction**: Suppress verbose "HttpMessageHandler cleanup" console logs in non-debug runs

## Version 0.3.15 - 2025-09-18
### .wabbajack File Hash Verification Fix
* **Hash Cache Issue**: Fixed corrupted .wabbajack files being used due to stale hash cache entries
* **Fresh Hash Verification**: .wabbajack files now always verify actual file hash instead of using cached values

### ModOrganizer.ini Path Handling Fix
* **Spaces in Directory Names**: Fixed Wine path conversion to properly quote paths containing spaces

### Proton Selection and Window Suppression (Linux)
* **Config-Aware Proton**: Reads `proton_path` from `~/.config/jackify/config.json` and uses `${proton_path}/proton`
* **Detection Order**: GE-Proton10-* (compatibilitytools.d) → Proton - Experimental → Proton 10.0 → Proton 9.0
* **No Wine Fallback**: Proton is now required; if not found, a clear error is logged
* **Window Suppression**: Suppresses Proton console windows via `DISPLAY=""`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY=""`, and `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="msdia80.dll=n;conhost.exe=d;cmd.exe=d` for texconv/texdiag/7z and prefix init
* **Debug Trace**: With `--debug`, logs a single line indicating Proton source (config/GE/Valve version)

### Archive Extraction Encoding Fix
* **Foreign Character Coverage**: Added degree symbol `°` to the special character list used to trigger the Proton 7z.exe fallback
* **User Report**: Handles files like `Mirror°.nif` correctly by routing extraction through Proton 7z.exe when needed

## Version 0.3.14 - 2025-09-15
### Nexus API Error Handling Improvements
* **404 Not Found Handling**: Added specific error messages for missing/removed Nexus mods with actionable user guidance
* **Enhanced Error Logging**: Improved error reporting with ArchiveName, Game, ModID, and FileID context for better troubleshooting
* **Manual Download Logic**: Removed inappropriate 404 fallback to manual downloads (file doesn't exist) while preserving 403 Forbidden fallback for auth issues

### Configurable Data Directory
* **Shared Config Integration**: jackify-engine now reads `jackify_data_dir` from `~/.config/jackify/config.json`
* **Replaced Hardcoded Paths**: All `~/Jackify/*` usages now use the configured data directory (prefixes, logs, temp, `.engine`, `downloaded_mod_lists`)
* **Complete Path Migration**: All application data now uses the configurable directory including caches (`GlobalHashCache2.sqlite`, `GlobalVFSCache5.sqlite`, `VerificationCacheV3.sqlite`, `PatchCache/`), encrypted data, image cache, and token storage.
* **Safe Fallback**: If config read fails, defaults to `~/Jackify`

## Project History

Jackify-Engine represents the **10th attempt** at creating a Linux-native Wabbajack fork. Previous attempts were destroyed by AI agents making unnecessary modifications to core systems that worked perfectly in upstream Wabbajack.

### Key Principles
* **Minimal Changes**: Only essential Linux compatibility modifications
* **Upstream Compatibility**: 1:1 identical output hashes to upstream Wabbajack
* **Performance Parity**: Target ≤39 minutes installation time (matching upstream via Wine)
* **Self-Contained**: No external dependencies required for published binary

### Critical Systems (Never Modified)
* Archive extraction logic (Wabbajack.FileExtractor)
* Resume functionality and temp directory handling
* VFS (Virtual File System) operations
* Core installation flow (StandardInstaller.Begin)
* 7zip integration and error handling

### Linux-Specific Features
* **Proton Integration**: Uses Steam Proton for texconv.exe execution
* **Linux Steam Detection**: Automatic detection of Linux Steam installations
* **Path Handling**: Linux-specific path conversion and case sensitivity handling
* **Build System**: Linux-optimized build script and distribution packaging

---

## Compatibility

* **Output Verification**: Identical file hashes to Windows Wabbajack installations
* **Performance**: Matches or exceeds upstream Wabbajack performance
* **Platform Support**: Linux x64 (tested on Steam Deck, Nobara, Ubuntu)

## Requirements

* **System**: Linux x64 with .NET 8.0 runtime
* **Steam**: Steam installation with Proton (Experimental, 10.0, or 9.0)
* **Storage**: Sufficient space for modlist installation and temporary files
* **Network**: Internet connection for mod downloads

## Usage
